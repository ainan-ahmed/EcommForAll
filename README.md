## Project Structure
See [Project Structure](https://github.com/ainan-ahmed/EcommForAll/blob/main/PROJECT-STRUCTURE.MD)

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
* npm / yarn / pnpm (choose one)
* Java JDK (version 17 or later for Spring Boot)
* Maven
* Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ainan-ahmed/EcommForAll.git](https://github.com/ainan-ahmed/EcommForAll.git)
    cd EcommForAll
```


2.  **Backend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the backend directory (e.g., `cd backend`).
    * Build the Spring Boot application:
        ```bash
        mvn clean install
        mvn spring-boot:run
        ```

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    * Navigate to the frontend directory (e.g., `cd frontend`).
    * Install dependencies:
```bash
        # Using npm
        npm install
        # Or using yarn
        # yarn install
        # Or using pnpm
        # pnpm install
```
### Running with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the entire application stack is using Docker Compose:

1.  Ensure Docker is running.
2.  From the root directory of the project:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    This will build the images for frontend and backend and start all services (frontend, backend, Database).

3.  Access the application:
    * Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
    * Backend API: `http://localhost:8080`
